    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the School of Interdisciplinary Research and Entrepreneurship (SIRE) at BITS Pilani. SIRE is designed to be the hub where electrical engineering meets entrepreneurship, empowering students to not only excel in technical expertise but also develop an entrepreneurial mindset.
</p>
<p>
    Our programs focus on fostering creativity, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. SIRE students and researchers work together to explore complex problems that require knowledge beyond traditional electrical engineering. Through our unique approach, we encourage individuals to think critically and create real-world solutionsâ€”whether that means innovating within renewable energy, smart grid technologies, robotics, or artificial intelligence systems.
</p>
<p>
    At SIRE, students have the freedom to experiment, fail, and succeed. With access to world-class labs, mentors from both academia and industry, and a curriculum that encourages hands-on learning, we prepare future leaders who will drive the next wave of technological and entrepreneurial advancements.
